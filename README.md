# Data Structures in C

Commonly used data structures implemented in C. This is meant to be a learning project and reference for myself, but all
implementations
are free to be used by anyone for any purpose.

I don't plan on expanding these to other languages, but I'm more than happy to open contributions to those who want to
do it. See [CONTRIBUTING](#contributing) if you're interested.

## List of Data Structures

- [ ] [Binary Tree](binary_tree.c)
- [ ] [Hash Map](hash_map.c)
- [x] [Linked List (Single)](linked_list.c)
- [ ] [Linked List (Double)](dbl_linked_list.c)
- [ ] [Rope](rope.c)
- [x] [Stack](stack.c)
- [x] [Queue](queue.c)
- [ ] [Vector](vector.c)
- ... more coming soon

## Testing

Tests are written using the fantastic [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) framework, and must be installed
in order to build the tests.

## Contributing

I'm currently open to contributions for the following:

- Implementations for languages other than C
- Unit tests
- Code documentation

If you have a suggestion for something that isn't in the above list, **please open an issue first** before
submitting a
pull request.
